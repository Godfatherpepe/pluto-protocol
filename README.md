# Pluto-protocol
PLUTO Protocol is an efficient BEP-20 token designed with built in gas-less yield rewards, stable holding incentives through liquidity, and deflationary fuel burn targets to accelerate Pepeâ€™s journey back to his home planet Pluto.

A fork from Safemoon with some reduced supply and better tokenomics powered by the people to get Pepe back home. First, the dev has minted the tokens - sent the balance to DxSale for fair launch - and then burned the remainder of the tokens after soft cap reached. Dev had to partake in presale. Second, utilized the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for 1 year. Simple tokenomics and elegant design and production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project. 100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible. #PepetoPluto join us on Pepe's journey beyond the moon and bring Pluto home!
